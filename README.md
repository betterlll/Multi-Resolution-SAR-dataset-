# Multi-Resolution-SAR-dataset
To promote the development of more general multi-modal image registration methods, the MultiResSAR dataset has been constructed as a large-scale, multi-source, multi-resolution, and multi-scene dataset specifically designed for optical and SAR image registration. As shown in Fig. 3, the dataset contains 10,850 pairs of optical and SAR images, covering SAR data from four commercial satellites, with resolutions ranging from 0.16 meters to 10 meters. The scene types include urban, rural, plains, hills, mountains, and water areas. Notably, high-resolution SAR images with a 16 cm resolution provided by the Umbra satellite were selected to create a test dataset consisting of 850 pairs of ultra-high-resolution SAR images. Corresponding optical image pairs were obtained through georeferencing, as shown in Fig. 4. A large number of experimental results show that existing registration algorithms cannot consistently maintain excellent performance across different sources, resolutions, and scenes. In particular, for ultra-high-resolution SAR image tests, no algorithm has efficiently handled this type of registration task. The registration problem of high-resolution SAR and optical images has become a major challenge in the multi-modal image registration field. Current algorithms exhibit significant instability when dealing with different imaging conditions and resolution variations, especially in the registration of high-resolution SAR and optical images. The construction of the MultiResSAR dataset aims to provide a standardized data foundation to promote the generalization and robustness of registration algorithms in multi-modal and multi-resolution image registration. Through further research and optimization, we aim to develop efficient registration methods suitable for multi-source, multi-resolution, and multi-scene scenarios, thus providing stronger support for remote sensing image fusion and analysis.
